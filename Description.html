            Our project is a wristwatch that can determine and track the location
            through a phone application. TagLine is a bracelet that determines the
            place and location, <br />and you can track the person wearing it
            through the application connected to the bracelet.You can also find out
            how many meters away he is from you.<br />The target group in this
            project are three categories of Alzheimerâ€™s patients, people with
            special needs, and children under the age of 15.<br /><br />
